planning for challenge lab team 2

use requests libray for api request 
given that we need to accses info from the open weather api when we make a request then we use the request library from python\
as a user I want to search for my city so that I can know the weather
given that the data is in jasn when we request it then we would need to parse the data using the json libary
split into two modules one for lat lng calls and one for calls by city 

things needed bellow:
there will probly be two fuction to call the api, one for long lat and one for city
there are 2-3 types of parameters to use for api calls
-city
-api key
-optional: limit and unit
